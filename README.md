This project is a **Machine Learning-based Loan Approval Prediction System** that predicts whether a loan application should be approved or not.  
Additionally, if the loan is **not approved**, it provides a **suggested loan amount** that the applicant deserves based on their income and credit history.  

## 🚀 Features  
- ✅ Predicts loan approval using **Random Forest Classifier**  
- ✅ Handles missing values, categorical encoding, and scaling  
- ✅ Includes **feature engineering** for better predictions  
- ✅ Optimized with **GridSearchCV** for best model parameters  
- ✅ **Streamlit Web App** for easy user interaction  
- ✅ Suggests deserving loan amount if the loan is rejected  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python 3.12+**  
- **Scikit-learn** (Machine Learning)  
- **Pandas, NumPy** (Data Processing)  
- **Streamlit** (Web App Deployment)  
- **Joblib** (Model Saving/Loading)
